Photosynthesis
Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use 
sunlight to synthesize foods from carbon dioxide and water. It usually involves the
green pigment chlorophyll and generates oxygen as a by-product.
Cell Division
Cell division is the process by which a parent cell divides into two or more 
daughter cells. It is essential for growth, repair, and reproduction in living 
organisms.
Respiration
Respiration is a biological process in which cells convert glucose and oxygen into 
energy (ATP), releasing carbon dioxide and water as waste products. It provides the
energy required for all cellular activities.
Newton’s Laws of Motion
1. An object will remain at rest or move in a straight line unless acted upon by an
external force.
2. The acceleration of an object depends on the net force acting upon it and the 
object's mass.
3. For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
